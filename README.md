# G-NodeOntology
This repository has been created for keeping progress of the owl ontology created with Protégé. The ontology tries to generally describe the data that participates in projects, however, at this point in time, focusing on projects from neuroscience. Along with the ontology, comes a ODS sheet that summarizes the content of the ontology.
